              <h3> Hello, I'm Niall, A software developer based in Dublin, Ireland. I like to build large, scalable web applications using both front and back end technologies </h3>
        </div>

        <div class="col-xs-6 col-lg-4">
            <p>I wanted to build a simple web site to link to and host various projects I've worked on over the years. I was also interesed in brushing up on AngularJS as professionally, I've been working mostly with the JavaScript framework, Dojo.</p>

            <p>I used bootstrap with some custom CSS for the page styles. I also experimented (maybe a little too much) with some basic animation.</p>

            <p>Please feel free to look around, connect with me through the social media links or leave a comment in the contact page.</p>
